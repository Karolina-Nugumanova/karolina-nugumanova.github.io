Welcome to my personal space online. I am a PhD researcher in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en/phd-programme-political-science-and-sociology), Florence. Presently, I'm an investigator of three research endeavors: [OutRush](https://outrush.io/eng), a comprehensive longitudinal survey delving into the experiences of Russian emigrants, [Science of Dreams](https://readymag.com/u94255285/wardreams/2/), a unique exploration into the dream narratives of Russians amidst wartime, and the project on Feminist Anti-War Resistance.

My academic journey gravitates towards topics like migration, gender studies, feminist theory, and the intricate dynamics of authoritarianism, political behavior, and repression. Beyond academia, my heart holds a special place for documentary filmmaking.

A proud alumna, I earned my MA in Sociology from [European University at St. Petersburg](https://eusp.org/en) and my BA from [Novosibirsk State University](https://english.nsu.ru/). Dive in to explore more about my work and interests!
