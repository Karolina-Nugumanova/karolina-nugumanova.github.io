Welcome to my personal space online. Presently, I'm deeply involved in two research endeavors: [OutRush](https://outrush.io/eng), a comprehensive longitudinal analysis delving into the experiences of Russian emigrants, and [Science of Dreams](https://readymag.com/u94255285/wardreams/2/), a unique exploration into the dream narratives of Russians amidst wartime.

My academic journey gravitates towards topics like migration, gender studies, feminist theory, and the intricate dynamics of authoritarianism, political behavior, and repression. Beyond academia, my heart holds a special place for documentary filmmaking.

A proud alumna, I earned my MA in Sociology from the [European University at St. Petersburg](https://eusp.org/en) and my BA from [Novosibirsk State University](https://english.nsu.ru/). Dive in to explore more about my work and interests!
