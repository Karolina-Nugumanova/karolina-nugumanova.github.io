I am a PhD researcher in Political and Social Sciences at the [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en/phd-programme-political-science-and-sociology) in Florence, supervised by Martín Portos García and Lorenzo Zamponi. My research explores how gender and emotion shape political activism among Russian emigrants after 2022, combining large-scale survey data, causal inference, and qualitative interviews.

I am a Сo-Investigator of [*OutRush*](https://outrush.io/eng) — a global panel study of post-2022 Russian migration cited by *The New York Times, Financial Times, Bloomberg, Al Jazeera, BBC, and Meduza*, among others — and a member of Democracy in Exile (*DemEx*), a project funded by the National Science Foundation (USA), NCN (Poland), and SSHRC (Canada). I also lead [*The Science of Dreams*](https://readymag.com/u94255285/wardreams/2/), a study of wartime dream narratives as a window into collective emotion and identity.

Before my PhD, I earned an MA and a BA in Sociology from the [European University at St. Petersburg](https://eusp.org/en)  and [Novosibirsk State University](https://english.nsu.ru/). In 2026, I will join the Institute of Social Science at the University of Tokyo as a Visiting Fellow under the supervision of Masaaki Higashijima.
