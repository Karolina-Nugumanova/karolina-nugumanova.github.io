The February Journal, 2023, 01-02: 63-82 (EN, RU).\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe article is devoted to reflecting on silence and speaking in the dreams of people in Russia after the 24th of February 2022. Our two-stage analysis of dream narratives and dreamers’ comments on them uncovers several key topics related to speaking and silence. Interpreting them with the apparatus of sociology, we conclude that these dreams provide a space for restoring agency that had been lost in real life.\n\n\n\nPublications is media\nHow do you sleep during the war?.

Co-authored with E. Kamalov and I. Sergeeva.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, gender dynamics in political activism have come to the fore. While the media has reported extensively on the rise of a feminist anti-war resistance movement, the question remains whether there are indeed tangible gender differences in the political behaviour of post-war migrants and, if so, what factors underpin these differences. Although historical narratives depict politics as a predominantly male domain, with women traditionally showing lower levels of political engagement, recent shifts suggest a more complex landscape. Analyzing data from the OutRush panel survey, this study reveals that women, despite reporting heightened feelings of depression and a bleak outlook, consistently exhibit increased political and civic activism compared to men—except in assistance to fellow Russians. Intriguingly, conventional indicators, such as political interest and trust, displayed no gender disparity. A regression analysis posits that feelings of responsibility and the urge for reparations account for the observed gender gap, suggesting that these emotions might play a pivotal role in fueling women’s political fervor. To refine our understanding of gendered motivations, a forthcoming Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis will examine whether emotions such as responsibility and reparations drive political and civic engagement differently across genders. The quantitative data is complemented by extensive qualitative research, including interviews with numerous feminist anti-war resistance activists. These interviews explore their personal views on the contrasting experiences of male and female activists, and examines how gender norms and institutional frameworks in their host countries either support or hinder their activist endeavours. This research hopes to illuminate the intricate tapestry of gendered political activism in post-war migration scenarios.\n\n\n\nInterviews\n«Кому-то снилось, что дыхание стало платным».
