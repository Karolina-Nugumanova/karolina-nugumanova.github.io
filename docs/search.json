Presently, I’m an investigator of two research endeavors: OutRush, a comprehensive longitudinal survey delving into the experiences of Russian emigrants, and Science of Dreams, a unique exploration into the dream narratives of Russians amidst wartime.\nMy academic journey gravitates towards topics like migration, gender studies, feminist theory, and the intricate dynamics of authoritarianism, political behavior, and repression. Beyond academia, my heart holds a special place for documentary filmmaking.\nA proud alumna, I earned my MA in Sociology from European University at St. Petersburg and my BA from Novosibirsk State University.

The February Journal, 2023, 01-02: 63-82 (EN, RU).\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe article is devoted to reflecting on silence and speaking in the dreams of people in Russia after the 24th of February 2022. Our two-stage analysis of dream narratives and dreamers’ comments on them uncovers several key topics related to speaking and silence. Interpreting them with the apparatus of sociology, we conclude that these dreams provide a space for restoring agency that had been lost in real life.\n\n\n\nPublications in media\nHow do you sleep during the war?.

While the media has reported extensively on the rise of a feminist anti-war resistance movement, the question remains whether there are indeed tangible gender differences in the political behaviour of post-war migrants and, if so, what factors underpin these differences. Although historical narratives depict politics as a predominantly male domain, with women traditionally showing lower levels of political engagement, recent shifts suggest a more complex landscape. Analyzing data from the OutRush panel survey, this study reveals that women, despite reporting heightened feelings of depression and a bleak outlook, consistently exhibit increased political and civic activism compared to men—except in assistance to fellow Russians. Intriguingly, conventional indicators, such as political interest and trust, displayed no gender disparity. A regression analysis posits that feelings of responsibility and the urge for reparations account for the observed gender gap, suggesting that these emotions might play a pivotal role in fueling women’s political fervor. To refine our understanding of gendered motivations, a forthcoming Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis will examine whether emotions such as responsibility and reparations drive political and civic engagement differently across genders. The quantitative data is complemented by extensive qualitative research, including interviews with numerous feminist anti-war resistance activists. These interviews explore their personal views on the contrasting experiences of male and female activists, and examines how gender norms and institutional frameworks in their host countries either support or hinder their activist endeavours. This research hopes to illuminate the intricate tapestry of gendered political activism in post-war migration scenarios.\n\n\n\nPublic speaking\nGuest speaker for the popular science lectures in one of St Petersburg’s cultural spaces on fiction and documentary film.

We specifically focus on their coping strategies, their modes of incorporation into receiving societies, their bonds with Russia, fears, and plans for the future. Women tend to feel more sorrow and pain, to miss their relatives and friends who stayed in Russia more than men, and are more often depressed and frustrated. Their political attitudes and political activities abroad also show diverse trends. Thus, women are more likely than men to take part in protests, sign petitions and post on social media. In addition, in both the first and second waves of the survey, women are more likely than men to volunteer, to help Ukrainian emigrants, and to donate to Russian and local NGOs. It is also noteworthy that women more actively try to integrate into the host community, learning local languages more readily than men. However, they were also more inclined to report experiencing discrimination from both locals in the host countries and local authorities. As we have 3 waves of data collected from the same people, we can trace the changes in various attitudes of women and men in emigration which allows for broader generalizations on the interaction of gender and migration status.\n\n\nGendered Response to War: Analysing Patterns of Political Activism of Post-War Russian Emigrants.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, gender dynamics in political activism have come to the fore.
