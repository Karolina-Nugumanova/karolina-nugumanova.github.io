The February Journal, 2023, 01-02: 63-82 (EN, RU).\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe article is devoted to reflecting on silence and speaking in the dreams of people in Russia after the 24th of February 2022. Our two-stage analysis of dream narratives and dreamers’ comments on them uncovers several key topics related to speaking and silence. Interpreting them with the apparatus of sociology, we conclude that these dreams provide a space for restoring agency that had been lost in real life.\n\n\n\nReports\nПолтора года спустя: прогресс и барьеры в интеграции российских эмигрантов.

Although historical narratives depict politics as a predominantly male domain, with women traditionally showing lower levels of political engagement, recent shifts suggest a more complex landscape. Analyzing data from the OutRush panel survey, this study reveals that women, despite reporting heightened feelings of depression and a bleak outlook, consistently exhibit increased political and civic activism compared to men—except in assistance to fellow Russians.

But time passes, and the person just stands silently outside the door. I still can’t see who it is, and then the door becomes almost transparent, and I realize that four guys are standing behind it. Standing silently, looking right at me. I hold the latch with my hand just in case. At first, I shout for them to go away, but I’m too scared and my voice is trembling. They don’t move. Then I start asking what they want, and the guys suddenly spring to life: still silent, they come up close and stare right at me’ (03/06/2022, F, age 20).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues, the role of gender in political activism is becoming increasingly critical. While media coverage has highlighted feminist anti-war movements, scholarly research remains less comprehensive. Our study contributes to a broader understanding of gendered responses to war by focusing on a unique subpopulation: Russian wartime migrants. Unlike their counterparts who remain in Russia, these migrants often have the ability to voice opposition to the war abroad. We draw on data from the OutRush panel survey and qualitative interviews to explore the complexity of gender differences in political activism among these migrants. By combining threat theory, political opportunity structure, and the concept of «voice, exit, loyalty» we try to understand if and how there is a gender gap and how it manifests itself after emigration. Our initial findings reveal a reverse gender gap: Russian migrant women are more politically and civically engaged than men, despite facing greater economic and social challenges after emigration, as well as a poorer psycho-emotional state. This finding is surprising, given the patriarchal and authoritarian contexts in which Russian women are socialized. To identify the factors explaining this gender gap, we use regression modelling and the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method. Our analysis shows that conventional predictors, such as political interest and trust levels, are not significant. Moreover, variables related to the different migration struggles experienced by women and men contribute little to explaining the gap. Instead, feelings of responsibility and a desire for reparations for war victims largely account for this gap. Interviews with female activists further emphasize the critical role that war-related emotions play in decisions about political participation, civic engagement, and even the choice to emigrate\n\nCross-border voices: emigration, gender, and activism in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

International Academic Conference (In)Visible Russian (Anti-)War Migration, March 13-15, 2024, Warsaw.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe war in Ukraine has catalyzed a significant emigration wave from Russia, with approximately one million (Re:Russia, 28 July, 2023) individuals leaving mainly due to political dissent against Putin’s regime. This study, utilizing data from three OutRush panel study, reveals these emigrants are predominantly younger, better educated, come from affluent backgrounds, and more politically active than the average Russian, with strong gender-egalitarian views and high trust in both compatriots and host nationals (Kamalov et al., March 2022). Their migration profoundly affects both origin and destination countries, influencing labor markets (Dustmann, Glitz, and Frattini, 2008), political landscapes (Kapur, 2014), and driving political changes in their countries of origin (Waldinger and Shams, 2023; Krawatzek and Müller-Funk, 2020; Barsbai et al., 2017). Their economic contributions and political activism potentially accelerate democratization processes (Escribà-Folch, Meseguer, and Wright, 2015; O’Mahony, 2013).Host societies stand to gain from these migrants’ gender-equality perspectives and political engagement, which can enrich public discourse and hasten gender equality progress. However, their activism is declining due to increasing fear of (trans)national repression. Interestingly, the study revealed the phenomenon of a reverse gender gap in activism after emigration: women are more active in political life and civic engagement in the host countries compared to men.Regression analysis and the Blinder-Ooxaca decomposition method show that such a gap can be explained by the fact that women feel more responsible for Russia’s actions in Ukraine and desire to compensate for the damage.In the two years since the beginning of the war, the psycho-emotional state of emigrants has changed. Сompared to September 2022, in the summer 2023 people show more optimism and less sadness, but trust in host institutions has decreased and worries about discrimination have increased. This article draws on quantitative data of three waves of panel survey OutRush and in-depth interviews with migrants and feminist anti-war activists to provide a comprehensive picture of the profile of Russian emigrants and the dynamics of their new post-war life.\n\nGendered Responses to War: Analyzing Differences and Underlying Factors in the Case of Russian Emigration, 2022-2023. 13th LCSR International Workshop “Recent Advances in Comparative Study of Values”.

Co-authored with Niсa Kostenko. The 2023 Aleksanteri Conference «Decolonizing Space in the Global East». University of Helsinki, Finland, 23rd -25th of October, 2023.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing Outrush panel data collected from the initiative independent project we study how women and men who emigrated from Russia after 24.02.2022 differ in their attitudes. We specifically focus on their coping strategies, their modes of incorporation into receiving societies, their bonds with Russia, fears, and plans for the future. Women tend to feel more sorrow and pain, to miss their relatives and friends who stayed in Russia more than men, and are more often depressed and frustrated. Their political attitudes and political activities abroad also show diverse trends. Thus, women are more likely than men to take part in protests, sign petitions and post on social media. In addition, in both the first and second waves of the survey, women are more likely than men to volunteer, to help Ukrainian emigrants, and to donate to Russian and local NGOs. It is also noteworthy that women more actively try to integrate into the host community, learning local languages more readily than men. However, they were also more inclined to report experiencing discrimination from both locals in the host countries and local authorities. As we have 3 waves of data collected from the same people, we can trace the changes in various attitudes of women and men in emigration which allows for broader generalizations on the interaction of gender and migration status.\n\nWar doesn’t have a woman’s face?
